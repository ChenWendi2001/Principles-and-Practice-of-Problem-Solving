## How to install this software?

### The first way

In `src` file, I contain all the source code, so you can compile it to get the executable file.

### The second way (Recommended)

I also contain a `visualizer.exe`.  You can use the **command line of Qt 5.9 (cmd or PowerShell may not work)** and execute `windeployqt visualizer.exe` to get all the dependencies.

### Step One

Click `visualizer.exe`.
